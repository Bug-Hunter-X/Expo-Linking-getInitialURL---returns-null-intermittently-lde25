This bug occurs when using the Expo `Linking` API to handle deep links.  Under certain conditions, the `getInitialURL` method may return `null` even when a deep link is successfully opened. This can happen if the app is launched with a deep link but the `Linking.getInitialURL()` method is called before the app is fully initialized. This is especially common in situations where the app has a splash screen or takes a noticeable amount of time to load.
